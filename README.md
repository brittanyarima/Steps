# Getting Started

* Fork this repo
* Clone the repo to your machine
* In the same folder that contains the `StepsConfigTemplate.xcconfig`, run this command, in Terminal, to create a new Xcode configuration file (which properly sets up the signing information)

```sh
cp StepsConfigTemplate.xcconfig StepsConfig.xcconfig
```

* In the StepsConfig.xcconfig file, fill in your `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` & `BUNDLE_ID`
   * Example: `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = IdNumber` & `BUNDLE_ID = com.name.steps`
   * You can find your Team ID by logging into the Apple Developer Portal
   * This is only needed when running on a real device for iOS, this works with both free or paid Apple Developer accounts.
* Build the project

* Checkout a new branch (from the `dev` branch) to work on an issue
Checkout any issue labeled `hacktoberfest` to start contributing.

* Start contributing!
* Submit PR to merge with `dev` branch
* If you've never contributed to open-source before there are a ton of great tutorials out there to help get you started
* Issues labeled `good-first-issue` are great for beginners.
